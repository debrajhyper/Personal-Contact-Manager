## 📑 About the project
We understand how important your contacts are, and we want to make it easier than ever to organize and manage them all in one place. That's why we built Personal Contact Manager, with a clean, simple design and powerful features that'll take you less than 10 seconds to get up and running.
<br/>

**The most user-friendly address book :**
I designed Personal Contact Manager to be as intuitive as possible so you can spend less time figuring out how to use it and more time managing your contacts. All of the features are laid out in a simple manner that makes it easy for you to manage your contacts from anywhere on any device.
<br/>

**It's all in one place :**
Personal Contact Manager brings together all the information you need about your contacts into one easy-to-use dashboard, so you can find what you need with a single search. It also includes an address book for storing names, addresses and phone numbers of important people.

><a href="https://pcm.vercel.app/">This</a> is a small effort from my side to build a medium scale project using React and Spring Boot technologies. The experience taught me so many things, as well as the challenges involved in overcoming problems encountered during the development phase. I consider this project very relevant to me as a full-stack developer. The people who helped me during the development phase are to be commended.
